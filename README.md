#### Wietse M. Boon & Alessio Fumagalli 

The [examples](./examples/) folder contains the source code for replicating the three test cases. The code is written in Python and depends on the [PyGeon](https://github.com/compgeo-mox/pygeon) package, which in turn depends on [PorePy](https://github.com/pmgbergen/porepy/tree/develop/src/porepy).
